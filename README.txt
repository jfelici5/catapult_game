I have two classes, Catapult.java, and CatapultGame.java.
Within Catapult.java, I initialize all variables and create the methods that drive behavior
in the game

In CatapultGame.java, I have the conditionals and gameplay aspect. 

The main method is in CatapultGame.java, and it is a call to method "gameLoop()",
which will loop the game infinitely until the user decides to quit.

HAVE FUN!!!
